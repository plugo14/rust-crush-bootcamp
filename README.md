Welcome to the official repository for the **Rust Crush Bootcamp**! 

Have you been hearing about Rust everywhere, but don’t know where to start?

This one-hour intensive bootcamp is designed for you. We'll start from the absolute basics to understand why Rust is so loved and powerful, then write our first code together. We will cover as many Rust fundamentals as possible in this packed 1-hour!

This is not a public event: registration is required to receive the link and participate. It's the perfect opportunity to take your first steps in a dedicated, distraction-free environment.

## 🎯 Who is this bootcamp for?

This event is specifically designed for **absolute Rust beginners**. It's perfect for you if:

* You already have programming experience in another language (like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.).
* You want to understand the fundamental concepts of Rust in a guided and practical way.
* You're looking for a quick yet effective introduction to decide if Rust is right for you.

---

## ⚙️ Key Prerequisites

To get the most out of this session, please ensure you have:

1.  **Basic Programming Knowledge**: You should know what variables, `if-else` statements, loops, and functions are in at least one other language.
2.  **(Highly Recommended) Rust Installation**: For an interactive experience, please arrive with Rust already installed on your computer.
    * **Installation Link**: Follow the official guide at [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## 🛠️ How to Verify Your Installation

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and try running `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`. If they output a version number without errors, you're all set!

## 💻 GitHub Repository

We will use this repository during the course to share code and examples. It's empty for now—we'll fill it up together:

## ⏳ Structure and Duration

I value your time and mine. That's why I've condensed everything into a **one-hour intensive bootcamp**. At the end of the hour, anyone who wants to can stay for an open Q&A session.

The agenda will be:

* **Phase 1: Introduction and Fundamentals**
    * Why Rust? A brief intro to its "superpowers" (performance, safety, concurrency).
    * Let's write and analyze our first `Hello, World!`.
    * Variables, data types, and functions: the foundations.

* **Phase 2: Rust's Key Concepts**
    * An introduction to Ownership and Borrowing: the heart of Rust's memory management.
    * A glimpse of slightly more advanced concepts (time permitting).
